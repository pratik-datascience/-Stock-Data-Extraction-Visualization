# Analyzing and Visualizing Job Market Trends for Data Analysts
## Project Overview

    This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (Coursera).
    The objective is to analyze real-world datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the data analyst job market using SQL,Python, Excel, and data visualization tools.
    
    Additionally, the project includes historical stock price and revenue analysis for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using yfinance and web scraping, with interactive visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.

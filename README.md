# Analyzing and Visualizing Job Market Trends for Data Analysts

## Project Overview

This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera.
The goal of this project is to analyze real-world datasets to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to the data analyst job market using SQL, Python, Excel, and Data Visualization tools.

Extract historical stock data and revenue information for Tesla and GameStop using yfinance and web scraping, then visualize the trends in interactive plots to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

Clean and prepare raw datasets for analysis

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Use SQL queries to extract insights

Visualize trends using Python libraries

Communicate insights through dashboards and reports

## 📊 Project Workflow

    Data Extraction

        Use yfinance to fetch stock data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME)

        Scrape quarterly revenue data from financial web pages using BeautifulSoup

    Data Cleaning

        Handle missing values and format revenue columns

        Reset indices and ensure proper datetime formatting

    Visualization

        Plot historical share prices and revenue trends using Plotly

        Create interactive dashboards with subplots for comparative analysis

    Dashboard Creation

        Generate dual-axis graphs showing stock performance alongside revenue changes

        Ensure visual clarity and user-friendly interactivity

## Visualizations

Skill demand bar charts

Salary distribution plots

Job trend line charts

Interactive dashboard (IBM Cognos)


##  Key Insights

    Tesla’s stock shows exponential growth post-2020

    GameStop revenue trends reflect market volatility during meme-stock events

    Interactive graphs allow for temporal analysis of stock vs. revenue correlation
